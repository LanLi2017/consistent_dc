Problem 1: How Git deals with "conflicts" in CSV files?
1. Create two branches
- Upload same data input CSV files
2. Update data input in OpenRefine with different recipes
- same operation, different parameters -> different modifications
- same cell, one with modification, another without 
3. Push various versions of CSV files to two branches separately 
4. Merge two branches.
