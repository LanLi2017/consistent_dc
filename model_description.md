## Data cleaning conflicts â€“ Model LL-1

### Data cleaning process and components
1. A **data cleaning process** is a sequence of **data cleaning steps** carried out on a particular data set.
2. A **data cleaning step** is an invocation of a particular data cleaning **operation** on a specific subset of cells in a data set.
3. A data cleaning **operation** is applied to dataset in different dimensions, including row level, column level, and cell level. 

### Operation characteristics and relationships 
1. The **write-scope** of a data cleaning operation is the set of cells whose values can be updated as a results of the operation.
2. The **read-scope** of a data cleaning operation is the set of cells that can affect the outcome of the operation.
3. The **full-scope** (or just **scope**) of a data cleaning operation is the union of write-scope and read-scope of the operation.
4. If cells within the **write-scope** of the first operation are **read-by** the second operation, we call **dependency** exists between these two operations.
5. The updates applied during a data cleaning process are **absolute concurrent** with the updates applied by a second data cleaning process if no cells within the **full-scope** of any of the data cleaning operations comprising the first process were updated by the operations comprising the second.

> I replace *compatible* with *absolute concurrent*
6. **Relative concurrent (RC)** operation is categorized into two types:
- **RC** originated from **read-scope**: cells within **read-scope** by two operations overlap.
e.g.,
[city, zipcode] &rarr; [city] ("lookup zipcode to repair city")
[state, zipcode] &rarr; [state] ("lookup zipcode to repair state")

- **RC** originated from **write-scope**: cells within **write-scope** by two operations overlap.
e.g.,
op1: [place] &rarr; [state,city,street] ("extract city information by splitting cell values in place")
op2: [place] &rarr; [place] ("normalize the separators in place by value replacement")


4. **Dependency violations**: 
- [Must] **RC** originated from **write-scope**
- [Might] **Dependent operation**



### Data cleaning workflow
A well-formed **data cleaning workflow** is depicted to represent **data cleaning workflow**. It comprises a sequence of data cleaning operations with **no violations**.

<!-- TODO: what is compatible -->
<!-- 3. **Order** is determined in the finalized **Linear Processing**. **Order** is agnostic across **Parallel Processing**. -->
